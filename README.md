# SOCodeChallenge
Hi this is my first project in github and I am currently doing a codebusters science olympiad event. So I made this webpage to help me solve Fractionated Morse ciphers. 

## What is Fractionated Morse Code?

- Fractionated Morse Code is a type of cipher that uses Morse code alphabet to encrypt a message . Morse Code alphabet is made up of dots and dashes. Each letter (A-Z) and numbers (0-9) will have its own pattern of dots and dashes. Decryption is used mostly in Science Olympiad, so that is why I focused on making this project on decryption of Fractionated Morse Code
- It is a polygraphic substitution cipher, meaning that it replaces plaintext into sets of symbols or letters
- There will be a key in the table which wil help letter for morse code mapping.
- ### Encryption
- Quotes will be encrypted by using morse code. The quote will be converted into morse code and the keyword will be given to map out. This will help you map out which encrypted text decodes to what. Keywords are filled in the Fractionated Morse Code Table at the first blank without using repeated letters. Then the letters that are not used in the keyword will be filled in the remaining space of the fractionated morse code table alphabetically.
- Fractionated Morse Code table is formed by all the combinations of "x", ".", and "-"'s. The only combination that cannot be used in Fractionated morse code is "XXX" because "xx separate words and "x" separates letters.
- ### Decryption
- In a problem, there will be a hint to solve the problem. For example, the quotes starts with "MITO" ,this is a hint. Using this hint you can find the keyword and solve the problem
- #### Steps
 1. First convert the hint into morse code. For example for "MITO" you would convert it to "--x..x-x---x"
 2. Split each characters into 3
 3. Fill the table by putting the letter that fits the 3 characters
 4. Using these hints, fill them in the problem then find out the keyword
  

## How to use this 
- To solve a new problem press "Generate New Cipher" 
- If you need a hint press "Give a hint", there are 2 options for the hints "Start with" and "Ends with" press the one that you want Then you can start solving the problem. If you need the fractionated morse table as a reference press the blue buttons that say "Morse Cod (a-m)" After finishing the problem there will be a blank text page below the question where you will have to enter the decoded message
- Then finally press "Check Answer" at the top




## Extra tools
    
- There is a 2 min timer that can help you time your problems
- If you need the keyword you can press on that to solve the problem
    
- Each time you finish a problem your score will go up by 1 point


Thank You for using this fun tool for helping you solve Fractionated Morse Ciphers faster
