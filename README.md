# SOCodeChallenge
Hi this is my first project in github and I am currently doing a codebusters science olympiad event. So I made this webpage to help me solve Fractionated Morse ciphers. 
How to use this
    To solve a new problem press "Generate New Cipher" 
    If you need a hint press "Give a hint", there are 2 options for the hints "Start with" and "Ends with" press the one that you want
    Then you can start solving the problem. If you need the fractionated morse table as a reference press the blue buttons that say "Morse Cod (a-m)"
    After finishing the problem there will be a blank text page below the question where you will have to enter the decoded message
    Then finally press "Check Answer" at the top
Extra tools
    There is a 2 min timer that can help you time your problems
    If you need the keyword you can press on that to solve the problem
    Each time you finish a problem your score will go up by 1 point

Thank You for using this fun tool for helping you solve Fractionated Morse Ciphers faster
