# SOCodeChallenge
Hi this is my first project in github and I am currently doing a codebusters science olympiad event. So I made this webpage to help me solve Fractionated Morse ciphers. 

## What is Fractionated Morse Code?

- Fractionated Morse Code is a type of cipher that uses Morse code alphabet. It includes Decryption and Encryption but decryption is used most in problems for 
  Codebusters.
- It is a polygraphic substitution cipher, meaning that it replaces plaintext into sets of symbols or letters
- There will be a key in the table which wil help letter for morse code mapping.
- ### Decryption
- In a problem, there will be a hint to solve the problem. For example, the quotes starts with "MITO" ,this is a hint. Using this hint you can find the keyword and solve the problem
- #### Steps
 1. First convert the hint into morse code. For example for "MITO" you would convert it to "--x..x-x---x"
 2. Split each characters into 3
 3. Fill the table by putting the letter that fits the 3 characters
 4. Using these hints, fill them in the problem then find out the keyword
  

## How to use this 
- To solve a new problem press "Generate New Cipher" 
- If you need a hint press "Give a hint", there are 2 options for the hints "Start with" and "Ends with" press the one that you want Then you can start solving the problem. If you need the fractionated morse table as a reference press the blue buttons that say "Morse Cod (a-m)" After finishing the problem there will be a blank text page below the question where you will have to enter the decoded message
- Then finally press "Check Answer" at the top




## Extra tools
    
- There is a 2 min timer that can help you time your problems
- If you need the keyword you can press on that to solve the problem
    
- Each time you finish a problem your score will go up by 1 point


Thank You for using this fun tool for helping you solve Fractionated Morse Ciphers faster
